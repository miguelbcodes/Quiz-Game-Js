# Simple Quiz Game

Simple quiz game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## My process

My main goal with this project was to make my first jump into javascript.

To develop it I learned the basics like variables, operators, strings and arrays methods, functions, loops and a little bit of objects and events.

But the most important subject I learned was the basics of the [DOM manipulation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents).

And the resources I used were [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [this article](https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqYiVHrO2U8&pp=ugMICgJwdBABGAE%3D).
